============

``GaiaAlertsPy`` was initially developed to search for stellar variability in the Gaia photometric science alerts. 
It was the primary tool used in the discovery of `Gaia17bpp (Tzanidakis et al. 2023) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aceda7>`_.
``GaiaAlertsPy`` would not be possible without the support of many other open-source projects, including `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_, `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_, and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
If you use `GaiaAlertsPy` in a scientific publication or data exploration workflows we ask that you please cite it and its dependencies.
